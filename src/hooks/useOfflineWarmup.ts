/**
 * Once the service worker is controlling the page, silently warm the
 * offline cache for the whole app - not just the pages the user has
 * already opened - so an installed/offline launch works right away.
 *
 * Two things need warming, for two different reasons:
 * 1. Each route's server-rendered HTML document (`fetch(url)`). This is
 *    what a fresh navigation needs - most importantly "/", since that's
 *    the PWA's start_url and is what loads when the installed app icon is
 *    opened. The very first time someone ever visits the site, that
 *    request happens *before* any service worker exists, so it's never
 *    cached unless we explicitly refetch it once the worker is active.
 * 2. Each route's JS chunk (`router.preloadRoute`), so that once "/" has
 *    loaded, navigating to any other page is a client-side transition
 *    that doesn't need the network at all.
 *
 * Node content itself (all layers, quizzes, related links, sources) is
 * static data bundled into the JS, not fetched per-node, so there's
 * nothing to warm per node id: every `/node/$id` URL is served by the
 * same route chunk. Warming it once (with any valid id) is enough to
 * make every node page available offline.
