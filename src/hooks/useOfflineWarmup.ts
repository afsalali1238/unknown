/**
 * Once the service worker is controlling the page, silently warm the
 * offline cache for the whole app - not just the pages the user has
 * already opened - so an installed/offline launch works right away.
 *
 * Two things need warming, for two different reasons:
 * 1. Each route's server-rendered HTML document (`fetch(url)`). This is
 *    what a fresh navigation needs - most importantly "/", since that's
 *    the PWA's start_url and is what loads when the installed app icon is
 *    opened. The very first time someone ever visits the site, that
 *    request happens *before* any service worker exists, so it's never
 *    cached unless we explicitly refetch it once the worker is active.
 * 2. Each route's JS chunk (`router.preloadRoute`), so that once "/" has
 *    loaded, navigating to any other page is a client-side transition
 *    that doesn't need the network at all.
 *
 * Node content is in two halves. The index (title, thesis, layer0,
 * related, tags for every node) is bundled into the JS, so every
 * `/node/$id` URL is served by the same route chunk and warming it once
 * (with any valid id) covers all of them. The bodies (layer1, layer2,
 * quiz, further reading) are 38 per-cluster JSON files under
 * /content/bodies/ — they're in the service worker's precache list (see
 * scripts/inject-manifest.ts), and this hook also pulls them into the
 * in-memory cache so the first node opened offline doesn't even need the
 * SW round-trip. The archive reader (`/read/$id`) fetches per-item
 * markdown, precached the same way; its route chunk gets the one-time warm.
