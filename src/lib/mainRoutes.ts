/**
 * Single source of truth for the app's top-level, statically-routable
 * destinations. Reused by BottomNav (so every tab lives here) and by
 * useOfflineWarmup (so a destination can't silently go missing from the
 * offline precache list without also disappearing from the nav - the exact
 * bug that shipped once already, see useOfflineWarmup.ts).
 *
 * The bar is Feed · Explore · Review · You — PRODUCT-BRIEF.md §5 (revised
 * 2026-09-04) and FEED-SPEC.md §7 option A. Review carries the due-count
 * badge: it is the retention loop's daily trigger and the brief calls it a
 * primary destination; it had been demoted to a link inside You, which left
 * the bar with three browse surfaces and zero retention surfaces.
 *
 * To add a new top-level tab: add it here first, then BottomNav picks it up
 * automatically and useOfflineWarmup's document list stays correct by
 * construction instead of by remembering to update a second array by hand.
