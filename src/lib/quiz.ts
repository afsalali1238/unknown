/**
 * A node's quiz options in a per-node shuffled order.
 *
 * Why shuffle: the authored data has the correct answer at index 1 in ~82% of
 * nodes, so an unshuffled quiz teaches "pick B" within a few cards and the
 * Leitner boxes end up measuring pattern-matching instead of recall. The
 * permutation is a pure function of the node id (plus an optional salt), so it
 * is stable across re-renders, identical on server and client (no hydration
 * mismatch), and never reshuffles under the user's thumb mid-answer.
 *
 * `salt` varies the order between sittings of the same node — Review passes
 * the Leitner box — so a returning user can't rely on "it was the third one".
