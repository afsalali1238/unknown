He argues most new technology is built the French way: it surveys an existing system — healthcare, financial markets, an old industry's workflows — and flattens it, importing its own 'topsoil' rather than incorporating what already worked. The maintenance cost then shows up later, paid by users rather than the system's designers, the way Versailles's upkeep was paid by taxed French subjects who never set foot in the garden.",
