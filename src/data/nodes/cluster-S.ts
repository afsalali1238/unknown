    thesis:
      "Most people fail to change because they try to change their actions while leaving their underlying identity — their 'character,' the operating system of beliefs and self-concept built up since childhood — untouched; real change requires deliberately reconstructing that identity, not just adding new habits on top of it.",
    layer0:
      "Koe frames identity, or 'character,' as an intellectual structure built over time, mostly assembled unconsciously in childhood as a byproduct of environment rather than chosen deliberately. His claim is that most self-improvement fails at the habit layer because habits are downstream of identity: you don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall back to the level of who you believe you are — so a new habit stacked on an unchanged self-concept tends to erode back to baseline.",
    layer1:
      "He proposes a two-track process: the external game, the goals and work you pursue in the world, and the internal game, the philosophical and psychological work of examining and rebuilding your self-concept, arguing the two are recursive — pushing further in the external game surfaces internal work you didn't know you needed, and skipping the internal work caps how far the external pursuit can go before it collapses back to old patterns. Practically, he sequences this as starting with superficial, concrete changes (health, finances, basic skills) before attempting deep identity work, since attempting spiritual transformation without any concrete track record tends to be avoidance dressed up as growth.",
    layer2:
      "Pick one change you've tried and failed to sustain. Was the failure really about the habit itself, or about an unchanged self-concept — 'I'm not really a person who does X' — pulling you back to baseline once willpower ran out?",

    thesis:
      "For most people starting out, a one-person business built around personal experience, skills, and interests, distributed through social media and no-code tools, is a more viable path to self-reliance than either traditional employment or a venture-scale startup, because it removes the capital and team requirements that used to gate entrepreneurship.",

      "Koe's argument starts from a structural observation: the internet removed the two things that used to make starting a business hard, needing capital and needing a team, since a single person can now build an audience, a storefront (website), and a product with a few hundred dollars and self-taught skills. His one-person business isn't freelancing, trading time for money on a single skill; it's built on what he calls the Experience Model — turning your own goals and problem-solving process into content and, eventually, a product others can buy to shortcut their own version of that same journey.",
    layer1:
      "He structures it around four pillars: Brand, the goal you're visibly pursuing, which people follow for the outcome, not just the content; Content, which compounds in an audience's mind over months, not single posts; Offer, starting with a deliberately small Minimum Viable Offer, a $500-1000 service or consulting package, rather than waiting for a polished product; and Marketing, consistent, newsletter and thread-driven distribution rather than paid ads. The mechanism that makes this scale is that all four pillars reinforce each other: content builds the audience that buys the offer, and delivering the offer generates the case studies and experience that become new content.",

      "If you had to define your Minimum Viable Offer today — something sellable in a week, priced at $500-1000, built entirely from experience you already have — what would it be, and what's stopping you from listing it this week instead of when it's 'ready'?",

    layer1:
      "He orders the stack as: a valuable message, requiring marketing (crafting something relevant and attention-grabbing) and sales (making people aware of a problem and presenting a solution), essentially persuasive communication; a medium for distribution, reduced to writing and speaking as the root skills underneath every platform, since a tweet, a video script, and a sales page are all, at bottom, writing; and results-oriented technical skills (email marketing, design, video) that only compound once the first two layers exist to give them an audience and a message worth applying them to. Skipping straight to the third layer, which is what most 'learn this skill' advice recommends, is why most people's technical skills don't translate into income.",

    layer1:
      "Practically, he runs what he calls a '2 hour content ecosystem': one long-form newsletter a week becomes a blog post, which gets broken into a thread, which gets broken further into daily tweets, meaning a single unit of writing gets repurposed across a week's worth of content on multiple platforms rather than requiring fresh material for each. The compounding effect isn't from any single post going viral, but from the same core message getting reinforced across many small touchpoints until, in his framing, the audience's understanding of what you stand for 'clicks' all at once, usually only after months of consistent output.",

His term 'the New Rich' describes people who've essentially opted out of this by building income and lifestyle around self-directed, focused work rather than a job requiring only reactive attention.",
    layer1:
      "A recurring theme is that focus fails less from lack of willpower and more from an unclear or unstable identity — without a clear sense of the person you're becoming, attention has no anchor and drifts toward whatever is most immediately stimulating, matching the identity-first argument in his Self-Architecture essay.

      "Modern disconnection and meaninglessness come from getting stuck in 'doing' — reactive tasks, consumption, status-seeking — without enough 'being' — direct present-moment experience — or conscious 'becoming'; reconnecting the three, deliberately, is how an individual builds a life that feels like it matters without needing an externally-assigned belief system to supply that meaning.",

      "Koe, crediting the framing to philosopher John Vervaeke's meaning crisis concept, diagnoses modern meaninglessness structurally rather than morally: an education system built for compliance rather than curiosity, combined with an information environment that keeps attention locked on 'next' — the next task, notification, or scroll — rather than 'now,' produces people who've never consciously chosen their own goals or values, and only notice the resulting emptiness once they achieve the goals they were handed.",
    layer1:
      "His fix is a feedback loop between three modes: Being, direct present-moment experience unclouded by rehearsing the past or projecting the future; Doing, action and contribution that flow from that clearer state rather than from anxiety or reflex; and Becoming, the identity shift that results from sustained doing, which then changes what you're capable of being and doing next. He argues most people get stuck almost entirely in doing mode, reactive, task-to-task, which narrows perception until meaning itself becomes hard to locate, and that deliberately building in unstructured time for being, not networking, not optimizing, just direct experience, is what reopens the loop.",

When you try to change in a way that threatens that identity, your mind reacts the same way it would to a physical attack: anxiety, distraction-seeking, and relapse aren't weakness, they're a defense mechanism protecting a self that doesn't want to be replaced.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism runs on four levers that work together: finding a reason with enough gravitational pull to override the old identity (though it fades and must be replaced); getting brutally honest about where your current trajectory actually leads, which is hard because 'the self doing the exercise is the self being evaluated'; changing your physical and digital environment faster than your old identity can recalibrate, since identity is partly stored in your surroundings; and widening the gap between impulse and response by doing nothing in the moment of urge, which is the only way to interrupt the survival mechanism in real time rather than just building better conditions around it.",

Fast content skips this ordering process and delivers pre-digested conclusions, leaving the reader 'informed but empty.' Slow content forces both writer and reader through the actual ordering process, which is why an essay can shift how someone thinks in a way a summary never does — and why Koe argues AI cannot write a genuine essay, since it lacks the situated, evolving point of view an essay is built from.",

The practical version is a 7-day protocol: days 1-2 cut input hard (limited work hours, no mindless media, unplugged walks); days 3-4 let suppressed thoughts surface (slow reading, sitting with nothing, more walking); days 5-6 rebuild genuine interest (resisting the urge to note everything, real unhurried conversation); day 7 creates from what's emerged, with no plan and no sharing yet, deliberately separating generative thinking from evaluative editing.",

He argues postmodernism correctly saw that no perspective is absolute but wrongly concluded none is better — a contradiction, since claiming all perspectives are equal is itself a value judgment.",

He maps a 'post-labor skill stack': agency (acting without permission), taste (discernment — solving the 'infinite library' and 'infinite monkey' problems of AI-generated noise), perspective (developmental capacity to hold complexity), persuasion (getting people to care, since art must merge with business), and technical know-how (offloading non-personal-touch tasks to AI).",

He distinguishes three types of work — Building (intense deep-work bursts creating something new), Maintenance (systemized repeat work keeping it alive), and Recovery (subconscious rest work almost everyone skips) — arguing one hour a day of real Building compounds into 365 hours a year, enough to change a life.",

Critically, rest isn't optional: the Default Mode Network activates during genuine rest (a walk with no phone, unstructured time) and does real cognitive work — successful creatives in Koe's account worked physically less than assumed, but 'were always thinking, plotting, and scheming,' then executed fast once an idea clarified during rest.",

    thesis:
      "Multiple interests aren't a lack of focus, they're the raw material for a durable competitive edge — a perspective only you have — but they need a 'vessel' (a brand built around your own development) to turn into income, or they stay tutorial-hell hobbies.",
    layer0:
      "Koe positions self-education, self-interest, and self-sufficiency as the three ingredients of a sovereign (rather than institution-dependent) mind, arguing industrial-era specialization made workers 'stupid and ignorant' by design (referencing Adam Smith's own warning about repetitive labor) so they'd stay dependent on employers and schools. Every interest pursued leaves a 'residue' that increases the connections your mind can make; specialization halts that process, which is why he compares the current moment to the Renaissance — before the printing press, multi-domain mastery (da Vinci, Michelangelo) was rare because knowledge itself was scarce, and the internet has reproduced that same explosion of access.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism for monetizing multiple interests runs through 'The Swap Test' logic applied to career: since attention is the scarce resource, you need to become a creator whose output can be discovered (not necessarily a 'content creator' in the cringe sense, but someone building publicly). Two paths: Skill-Based (learn one marketable skill, teach it, sell around it — one-dimensional, risks becoming a second 9-5) versus Development-Based (pursue your own goals as the brand, teach what you learn as content, help others reach the same goal as the product) — in the second path, you become your own customer avatar, which is why it suits people with multiple interests rather than a single niche.",
    layer2:
      "List three unrelated interests you've pursued without a clear 'point.' What connects them, and who is one step behind you on that exact combined path who'd pay for a shortcut?",
    quiz: {
      question:
        "Why does Koe argue the Development-Based path (brand = your own goals, content = what you learn, product = helping others reach the same goal) suits people with multiple interests better than the Skill-Based path?",
      options: [
        "Because it requires no marketing skills at all",
        "Because it guarantees faster income than any other business model",
        "Because it doesn't force you to niche down into one marketable skill — you become your own customer avatar, so pursuing several interests together becomes the business rather than a distraction from it",
        "Because it was invented specifically for the AI era and didn't exist before",
      ],
      correctIndex: 2,
      explanation:
        "The Skill-Based path is one-dimensional and risks recreating a second job around a single skill; the Development-Based path uses your own multi-interest growth as the product itself.",

    author: "Dan Koe",
    year: 2026,

    category: "Agency",
    thesis:
      "The one skill that stays relevant regardless of which specific skills get automated is agency — the ability to act, iterate, and adapt without permission — because access to knowledge has never been the bottleneck; the willingness to act on it has.",
    layer0:
      "Koe defines agency as more than initiative — it's 'an undying commitment to iteration,' treating your own life like an experiment with a hypothesis, expected failures, and course corrections, versus the 'employee mindset' that waits to be assigned a task and treats failure as proof the goal was impossible. He cites Spiral Dynamics-style development models estimating roughly half the population sits at a conformist cognitive stage, meaning they lack the developmental groundwork for genuine agency regardless of how much they talk about wanting it.",
    layer1:
      "He walks through three traits of high-agency behavior — iterating without waiting for permission, treating goals as hypotheses to test rather than promises to fulfill, and believing 'difficult' goals are achievable (contrasting with Seligman's learned-helplessness dog experiment, where previously-shocked dogs stopped trying to escape even once an easy exit was available) — then argues AI doesn't threaten agency, it exposes its absence: knowledge access has exploded, yet most people still do nothing with it, proving access was never the bottleneck. He closes with a five-capability argument (computation, transformation, variation, selection, attention) for why AGI doesn't obviously exceed human capacity at any of them, since all are ultimately bound by the same laws of time and physics.",
    layer2:
      "Name one 'difficult' goal (not impossible, but currently beyond your skills/resources) you've quietly written off as unrealistic. What's the smallest experiment you could run this week to test whether it's actually a Seligman-style learned helplessness, rather than a real limit?",
    quiz: {
      question:
        "Per Koe, what does the explosion of AI-accessible knowledge actually prove about most people's stalled progress?",
      options: [
        "That AI has made human effort obsolete",
        "That knowledge itself has become worthless",
        "That formal education is now completely unnecessary",
        "That access to knowledge was never the real bottleneck — most people still do nothing meaningful with nearly unlimited access, which means the missing ingredient was always agency",
