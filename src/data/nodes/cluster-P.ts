    thesis:
      "Wealth (assets that earn while you sleep) is distinct from money (a transfer of time and wealth) and status (a zero-sum position in a social hierarchy) — and only wealth creation is a positive-sum game worth optimizing for.",
    layer0:
      "Naval draws a three-way distinction: wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep (a business, equity, property, code, media); money is simply how we transfer time and wealth between people (a medium of exchange, not a store of value in itself); status is your position in a social hierarchy, which is necessarily zero-sum — for you to rise in rank, someone else must fall. He argues chasing status is a trap precisely because the gains are relative and can't compound for everyone at once, while wealth creation is genuinely positive-sum: you can build something that makes the world better off and capture value as a byproduct.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism is a reframing of ambition around ownership of appreciating, income-generating assets rather than a paycheck or social rank: equity in a scalable business (or another compounding asset) can keep paying out even while you're asleep or absent, whereas both a salary and social status require your continued, direct presence to maintain — the moment you stop showing up, they stop accruing. This is why the thread's advice clusters around 'own equity' and 'build or buy assets' rather than 'negotiate a higher salary' or 'climb the org chart.'",
    layer2:
      "Look at how you've spent your ambition this month — how much of it went toward chasing status (being seen as smart, senior, or impressive) versus building an asset that would still pay out if you disappeared for a year? What's one thing you could shift toward the second?",

Leverage is the multiplier applied to your judgment and effort: labor (people working for you) and capital (money) are 'permission-based' leverage — someone has to hand them to you — while code and media are 'permissionless' leverage, since anyone can create and scale them without asking anyone's approval.",

    author: "Naval Ravikant",
    year: 2019,
    medium: "Essay",
    category: "Decision-Making",
    thesis:
      "In an age of near-infinite leverage, judgment — not effort or intelligence alone — becomes the scarcest and most valuable resource, since small differences in being 'right' get massively amplified.",
    layer0:
      "Judgment, in Naval's usage, means the ability to make correct decisions under uncertainty with incomplete information — distinct from raw intelligence or hard work. He argues that historically, what you could accomplish was capped by your own labor, so judgment mattered but within limited bounds; today, leverage (code, media, capital) means one person's judgment, right or wrong, gets applied at a scale that used to require an entire organization to achieve.",
    layer1:
      "Naval's essay argues that someone whose judgment is correct 85% of the time, rather than 75%, isn't just 'modestly better' — once that judgment is applied through high leverage (a piece of code, a large fund, a media platform reaching millions), that ten-percentage-point edge in accuracy compounds into a dramatically larger share of outcomes, which is why elite investors, founders, and operators can capture returns wildly disproportionate to the actual gap in their skill. (The popular paraphrase 'he who is right most often wins' circulates widely online but isn't a verified direct Naval quote — the argument above is the actual, sourced version from nav.al/judgment.)",

      "The argument is that treating happiness as a pursuit is self-undermining, because wanting to be happier is itself a form of discontent with the present moment; instead, Naval frames happiness as something learned by removing specific, identifiable sources of unhappiness — unresolved desires, resentments, comparisons — rather than added through specific new acquisitions. It's closer to a subtraction practice than an accumulation one.",
