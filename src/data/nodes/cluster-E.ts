    thesis:
      "An option can be priced by constructing a continuously rebalanced hedge, yielding a closed-form value independent of the investor's risk preferences.",
    layer0:
      "An option is a contract giving you the right (not the obligation) to buy or sell a stock at a fixed price later. The hard problem was always: what should that right cost today? Black and Scholes showed that if you continuously buy and sell just the right amount of the underlying stock alongside the option, you can build a combined position that has zero risk — it earns exactly the risk-free interest rate no matter what the stock does. Because that riskless combination has a knowable value, you can work backward and solve for what the option itself must be worth, using only five measurable inputs: the stock price, the strike price, time remaining, the risk-free rate, and the stock's volatility.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism is arbitrage-based hedging, not forecasting. The insight isn't 'predict where the stock will go' — it's 'construct a portfolio (long the stock, short the option, in a precise ratio that changes continuously) whose value doesn't depend on where the stock goes at all.' Because that hedged portfolio is riskless, basic market logic (no free lunches) forces its return to equal the risk-free rate — otherwise arbitrageurs would exploit the gap until it closed. Solving that equation backward gives a single, closed-form price for the option that doesn't require knowing the stock's expected future return or the investor's personal risk tolerance — only its volatility. That's what made it usable at industrial scale: two counterparties with wildly different views on where a stock is headed can still agree on the option's fair price.",
    layer2:
      "Imagine you own a share of stock and you're worried it might drop before you can sell it, but you don't want to sell now. If you could continuously adjust a side bet against the stock so that your combined position barely moves regardless of the price, would you care anymore whether the stock goes up or down in the meantime? That's the intuition Black-Scholes formalizes into math.",
