    layer0:
      "Digital cash has an obvious problem: a digital file is trivially easy to copy, so what stops someone from spending the same digital coin twice? Historically this was solved by having a trusted central authority (a bank) keep the official ledger of who owns what. Nakamoto's proposal removes the need for that trusted third party entirely: every transaction is broadcast to a network of computers, bundled into 'blocks,' and each block is cryptographically chained to the one before it. Network participants ('miners') compete to solve a computationally expensive puzzle to add the next block, and the network simply agrees that whichever chain has the most accumulated computational work behind it is the true history.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism (proof-of-work) makes rewriting history expensive on purpose. To double-spend a coin, an attacker would need to secretly build an alternate chain of blocks starting from before the transaction they want to reverse, and make that alternate chain longer (more computational work) than the real chain the rest of the network is building — which requires out-computing the majority of the network's combined processing power simultaneously, an enormously expensive and impractical feat as the network grows. Because everyone independently verifies the chain with the most accumulated proof-of-work, no central party needs to be trusted to keep the ledger honest — trust is replaced by raw computational cost.",
    layer2:
      "Think of a shared group expense ledger (like splitting rent or a group trip) where everyone currently just trusts one person to keep the spreadsheet honest. What would it take to replace that trust with a system where everyone could independently verify the ledger was accurate, without needing to trust any single person? What would be expensive or annoying about that compared to just trusting one person?",

      "Published during a brutal bear market when Bitcoin skeptics were declaring it dead, Boyapati's essay reframed the entire debate: Bitcoin wasn't failing to become a medium of exchange (something you buy coffee with), it was still early in the process of becoming a store of value (something people hold because they trust it'll retain worth) — a necessary earlier stage that historically precedes anything becoming widely used as everyday money. Using Austrian economic theory, he lays out four stages any monetary good passes through: collectible, store of value, medium of exchange, and finally unit of account — and argues Bitcoin was transitioning from the first stage into the second.",

A good only becomes a useful medium of exchange once enough people already trust it holds value reliably (store of value) — trying to skip straight to 'spend it on coffee' before that trust is established is backwards, historically speaking (gold followed the same stages over centuries). Boyapati argues Bitcoin's specific properties — a strictly capped, disinflationary supply of 21 million coins, and resistance to censorship or seizure by any single authority — give it structural advantages over both fiat currency (which can be printed without limit) and gold (which is heavy, hard to verify, and hard to transport) for the store-of-value stage specifically, even while its price remains volatile during that transition.",

Buterin's whitepaper proposed a blockchain built from the start to run any program (Turing-complete, meaning it can compute anything a general-purpose computer can, given enough resources), where developers write 'smart contracts' — code that executes exactly as written, automatically, with no company or server able to shut it down, alter it, or interfere with it once deployed. This turns a blockchain from just a ledger of currency balances into what's often described as a 'world computer.'",

This single design choice (a fee-metered, general-purpose computer with no owner) is what allowed later innovations — DeFi lending markets, NFTs, DAOs — to be built entirely as code on top of Ethereum without needing Ethereum itself to be redesigned for each one.",

Monegro's thesis: in crypto, this inverts. Because blockchain data is shared and open rather than proprietary, applications built on top have a much weaker moat, while the base-layer protocol token itself directly captures speculative and economic value as the whole ecosystem of applications built on it succeeds.",

A blockchain application typically can't hoard its data — it's on a public, shared ledger by design — so a competing application can often just fork the code and data and compete directly, weakening the individual application's moat. But the protocol token itself (Ether, for example) is required to use the network at all, so as more applications launch and succeed on top of a given protocol, demand for the underlying token rises in tandem, meaning value concentrates at the base layer rather than the application layer — an argument that directly justified tens of billions of dollars of 'Layer 1' investing rather than application-layer investing during the 2017-2021 crypto cycles.",

On Ethereum, maintaining a live order book on-chain is prohibitively slow and expensive because every order update costs a transaction fee. Uniswap's whitepaper proposed something structurally different: an Automated Market Maker (AMM), where a smart contract holds a pool of two tokens, and prices are set automatically by a simple formula rather than by matching human orders at all — anyone can trade against the pool at any time, and anyone can deposit tokens into the pool to earn a share of trading fees.",

If you trade token A for token B, you're adding to the A side of the pool and removing from the B side — and because the product must stay constant, removing a larger amount of B (as the trade gets bigger) requires disproportionately more A, meaning the price you get worsens as your trade size grows relative to the pool. This makes pricing fully automatic and requires no counterparty on the other side of your specific trade — you're always trading against the pool itself, governed only by the formula, with liquidity providers earning a small fee (commonly 0.3%) on every trade in exchange for supplying the reserves.",

This creates a trustworthy, decentralized timestamp: since generating the sequence takes real, unavoidable time, and verifying it is fast, the network gets a shared sense of 'when' something happened without needing nodes to negotiate about timing in real time. Combined with a fast execution runtime, this lets Solana process a very high volume of transactions per second compared to blockchains that must spend more time and communication on ordering consensus alone.",

A cryptonetwork's rules are enforced by open protocol and, often, token-based governance shared among many participants, meaning no single company can unilaterally decide to change the terms once everyone else is locked in — which, in theory, keeps the network's incentives aligned with its whole ecosystem indefinitely rather than just during its early growth phase.",

    title: "IPO 2.0 / SPAC Investor Letters",
    author: "Chamath Palihapitiya",
    year: 2020,
    medium: "Letter",
    category: "Crypto",
    thesis:
      "SPACs democratize access to high-growth pre-IPO companies and are a superior path to public markets.",
    layer0:
      "A traditional IPO involves a lengthy roadshow, investment-bank underwriters, and pricing that Palihapitiya argued systematically favored large institutional investors at the expense of retail investors and even the company going public. He rebranded a decades-old financial structure — the Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC, a shell company that raises money first and merges with a private company later — as 'IPO 2.0,' arguing it let retail investors get in earlier and let private companies negotiate a price directly rather than through an underwriter-controlled process.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism bypasses the traditional IPO roadshow: a SPAC raises capital via its own public listing first, with no operating business yet, then merges with a private target company the sponsor selects. Because the deal is a merger rather than a traditional securities offering, the target company can share forward-looking financial projections that would be legally restricted in a standard IPO prospectus, and the whole process can move faster since it isn't gated by traditional underwriter due diligence and roadshow scheduling. Palihapitiya's public, retail-facing marketing of this structure (naming his vehicles memorably, writing accessible investor letters) is what turned a previously obscure financial structure into a mainstream retail investment vehicle, fueling the 2020-2021 SPAC boom that moved hundreds of billions of dollars.",
    layer2:
      "Think of a slow, gatekept process you've encountered (in finance, hiring, publishing, or elsewhere) where the traditional path favors insiders/institutions over newcomers. What would the 'SPAC equivalent' look like — a faster, more direct alternative path — and what legitimate safeguard from the traditional process might get lost along the way?",
    quiz: {
      question: "What specific advantage did Palihapitiya claim SPACs had over traditional IPOs?",
      options: [
        "SPACs are legally required to have lower fees than IPOs — a handy abbreviation that hides the counter-condition the argument requires.",
        "SPACs let companies share forward-looking financial projections (restricted in traditional IPOs) and bypass the underwriter-controlled roadshow, giving retail investors earlier and more direct access",
        "SPACs guarantee a higher stock price than a traditional IPO — a compact misstatement that leaves out the scope in which the claim holds.",
        "SPACs eliminate the need for any regulatory disclosure at all — an intuitive gloss that confuses the enabling condition with the outcome.",
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation:
        "SPACs bypass the traditional IPO roadshow and allow companies to market themselves using future financial projections, which supporters argue democratizes early-stage investment for retail investors.",
