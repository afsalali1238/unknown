      "The proposed mechanism is that a fixed mindset makes any failure feel like evidence about a permanent, unchangeable trait — so avoiding failure, and therefore avoiding challenge, becomes rational — while a growth mindset reframes failure as informative feedback about current skill rather than a verdict on fixed potential. Subsequent large-scale, independent replications found this effect is much smaller in the real world than in Dweck's original lab studies, and that simply telling people to 'have a growth mindset' without structural support does little on its own.",

The core criticism is that this pattern-matching approach selectively surfaces confirming studies — and sometimes cites research that doesn't precisely test the specific claim made — rather than systematically weighing the full, more mixed body of nutrition evidence.",

    layer1:
      "Her research followed high-attrition environments — West Point's Beast Barracks, the National Spelling Bee, novice teachers in difficult schools — and found grit scores predicted who persisted and improved better than measures of talent alone. The core critique is that showing grittier people succeed more isn't the same as showing that teaching grit causes more success, and that focusing on an individual trait like grit can obscure how much of the 'quitting' it's meant to explain is actually a rational response to structural barriers (under-resourced schools, unstable environments) rather than a personal deficit.",

Duhigg's 'Golden Rule of Habit Change' instead keeps the cue and the reward exactly the same and only swaps the routine in the middle — which is why, for instance, replacing a stress-triggered snack habit works best when the replacement still delivers a comparable reward (a walk, a call to a friend) rather than just removing the snack and leaving the craving unanswered.",
