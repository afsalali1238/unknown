      "The exaptation model matters specifically because it counters 'functional fixedness' — the tendency to see your skills only through the lens of their original use (e.g., 'I'm good at status updates' rather than 'I can parse complex information for a non-expert audience and build trust quickly'), which is exactly the kind of reframing that reveals genuinely transferable capability across a career change that looks, on the surface, unrelated to your current path.",

    year: 2022,

    thesis:
      "Rather than adopting rigid parenting tactics that may not fit your specific child, five underlying principles — adaptation, velocity, algebraic equivalence, seizing the middle, and inversion — generalize across any family, situation, or child, because they're principles rather than one-size-fits-all scripts.",
    layer0:
      "The five models are: adaptation (parenting rules can differ by context — home vs. public, child vs. child — without being 'inconsistent,' just as species adapt differently to different environments); velocity (are you spending time with direction toward a goal, or just moving fast without purpose); algebraic equivalence (two things can be different yet equal, e.g., different amounts of attention to different children can still represent equal love, the way x+y=5 has many valid solutions); seizing the middle (like chess, control the central territory — mutual trust and respect — rather than fighting every minor battle); and inversion (sometimes progress comes from removing an obstacle, not adding a new tactic).",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism that makes these five 'generalize' where specific tactics don't is that they're principles about how to think, not prescribed behaviors — a rule like 'always let children cry it out' either fits a specific child and situation or it doesn't, but a principle like 'seize the middle territory of trust, not every minor battle' can be applied freshly to whatever specific conflict arises, adapting the tactic to the child rather than forcing the child to fit a fixed tactic.",
    layer2:
      "Think of a current recurring conflict with a child (or in any close relationship). Is it a 'middle territory' issue (affecting trust and respect) or a 'fringe' issue you could let go without real cost — and inverted, what obstacle could you remove rather than what new rule could you add?",

    layer1:
      "The reason the long game is 'simpler but not easier' is that the formula itself isn't in dispute (spend less than you make, invest the difference, wait) — the difficulty is entirely in patience and repeated tolerance for short-term discomfort with no visible payoff yet, which is exactly why so few people actually execute it even though almost everyone intellectually agrees it works; the tiny, invisible advantage compounding today is easy to dismiss precisely because you can't see it yet.",

Structural mapping sketches how the parts of a system fit together — mentally or on paper — the same way you'd map a new codebase or a new language's grammar.

    category: "Learning Methods",
    thesis:
      "Genuine understanding is tested by whether you can explain a concept simply enough for a child, and genuine retention is engineered by spacing review intervals according to how well you already know the material — two separate mechanisms that most study habits conflate into one vague 'studying' activity.",
    layer0:
      "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet. That's the entire Feynman Technique in one sentence.",
    layer1:
      "The Feynman Technique has four steps: select a topic and study it, explain it in plain language as if teaching a child, identify the specific gaps where your explanation breaks down or gets vague, then return to the source material to fill exactly those gaps. The Leitner System handles the separate problem of retention over time: flashcards move between boxes reviewed at different frequencies (3x/week, 2x/week, 1x/week) based on how reliably you're recalling them, so your limited review time concentrates on what you're actually failing rather than re-reviewing what you already know cold.",
    layer2:
      "The two techniques solve different problems and are often wrongly treated as interchangeable: Feynman tests whether you understand a concept's structure, Leitner optimizes when you revisit a fact you already understand so it doesn't decay. Which of your current 'studying' habits is actually neither — just passive exposure with no explanation and no spacing?",

The DiSC model separately maps behavioral style on Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness — used practically to predict how someone prefers to communicate and make decisions under pressure.",

These aren't fabricated; the numbers are real and the statistical correlation is real. What's missing is any causal mechanism connecting them. The project exists specifically to make an abstract warning ('correlation isn't causation') impossible to forget, by showing just how easily a strong correlation appears between variables that obviously can't be causing each other.",

The next time a chart convinces you of a cause, ask: is there a plausible mechanism, or did someone just find one match among thousands of comparisons?",
