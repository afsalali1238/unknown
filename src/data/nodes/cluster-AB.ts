His law of segregation (each parent's two copies of a trait separate, passing only one to each offspring) and law of independent assortment (different traits are typically inherited independently of each other) were derived purely from breeding statistics — the physical basis (genes on chromosomes, later DNA) wouldn't be understood for decades.

Dobzhansky's essay argued this synthesis wasn't just one useful theory among many in biology — it was the necessary organizing lens for the entire field, since anatomy, behavior, ecology, and disease resistance all only become fully coherent once understood as products of this same evolutionary process.",

This meant complex ('eukaryotic') cells didn't arise through gradual internal mutation alone, but through a merger between separate organisms — cooperation, not just competition, was a major creative force in the history of life.
