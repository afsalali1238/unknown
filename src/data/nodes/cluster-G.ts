      "In traditional software ('Software 1.0'), a human engineer writes explicit step-by-step instructions telling the computer exactly what to do in every situation. Karpathy's argument: a large and growing share of valuable software is now better built a completely different way — you define a goal (a loss function measuring how wrong the model currently is), provide labeled examples, and let an optimization algorithm (like gradient descent) search through billions of possible internal settings until it finds ones that achieve the goal. The 'program' that results isn't human-readable code — it's a giant set of numbers (weights) that a human didn't write line by line.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism is replacing hand-specification with search-plus-data. In Software 1.0, if you want a program to recognize cats in photos, an engineer would have to manually write rules about edges, shapes, and colors — a nearly impossible task to get right by hand. In Software 2.0, you instead show the system millions of labeled photos (cat / not cat) and let an optimizer adjust internal weights until the network's predictions match the labels as closely as possible. The 'source code' becomes two things: the architecture of the network, and the dataset it was trained on — meaning that improving the software increasingly means improving your data pipeline, not just your codebase.",

Mikolov and colleagues at Google showed that by training a simple neural network to predict a word from its surrounding context (or vice versa) across huge amounts of text, you get a byproduct that turns out to be far more valuable than the prediction task itself: every word ends up represented as a point (a vector) in a high-dimensional space, positioned such that words used in similar contexts end up near each other, and consistent relationships (like 'male-to-female' or 'country-to-capital') show up as consistent directions you can add or subtract.",

Neither prediction task is the actual goal; the goal is the internal numerical representation (embedding) the network is forced to build in order to get good at that prediction task at all. Because words that appear in similar contexts get pushed to similar locations in this vector space, the geometry ends up encoding real semantic and relational structure — enabling vector arithmetic like king − man + woman ≈ queen — purely as an emergent property of the prediction objective, without anyone explicitly programming in the concept of gender or royalty.",

In 2012, a deep convolutional neural network trained by Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton entered and won by such a wide margin that it upended the field's consensus: a network with enough layers, trained on enough labeled images, using specific practical tricks to make training feasible, could learn better visual features on its own than experts could design by hand.",

None of these tricks were individually brand new, but combining them let a deep network finally be trained in a practical amount of time at a scale that outperformed hand-engineered approaches.",

      "Before ResNet, adding more layers to a deep neural network usually helped performance up to a point — and then made things worse, even on the training data itself, which ruled out overfitting as the explanation. The real problem was that training signals (gradients) had to travel backward through every layer during training, and in very deep networks that signal would shrink to almost nothing by the time it reached the earliest layers (the 'vanishing gradient' problem), making those layers nearly impossible to train properly. He, Zhang, Ren, and Sun's fix: add 'skip connections' that let the signal bypass a block of layers entirely if needed, so a layer only has to learn the difference (the 'residual') from what came before, rather than reconstructing the whole transformation from scratch.",

      "The mechanism is structural, not just a training trick: instead of asking each block of layers to learn a completely new mapping from input to output, ResNet reframes the task as learning a residual — the specific correction needed on top of just passing the input straight through unchanged. If a given block turns out not to be useful, the network can effectively learn to make it a no-op (its weights get pushed toward zero) and the skip connection carries the original signal straight through undamaged. This let networks scale from roughly 16 layers to over 150 layers, and the 152-layer version achieved a top-5 error rate of 3.57% on ImageNet — surpassing typical human-level performance on that specific benchmark.",

This was slow to train (you can't easily parallelize a process that depends on the previous step finishing first) and struggled to preserve context across long distances in a sentence. Vaswani and colleagues proposed processing the entire sequence at once, using a mechanism called 'self-attention' that directly calculates how relevant every word is to every other word in the sequence, regardless of how far apart they are.",

Because these relevance calculations for all word-pairs can be done simultaneously rather than one step at a time, Transformers parallelize far better on modern GPU hardware than the recurrent models they replaced, which is what made training on internet-scale text datasets computationally feasible in the first place — directly enabling the large language models that followed.",

This gave labs a rare thing in machine learning research: a way to forecast how much better a bigger model would be, before actually building it.",

      "DeepMind trained over 400 language models of varying sizes to empirically map out what actually minimizes error for a given amount of compute. Their finding directly corrected the earlier OpenAI scaling-laws guidance: rather than mostly growing parameter count, model size and training data should scale up together, roughly in equal proportion. Their 70-billion-parameter 'Chinchilla' model, trained on far more data (1.4 trillion tokens) than GPT-3's 175 billion parameters had been (roughly 300 billion tokens), ended up outperforming the much larger model.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism is a straightforward but consequential re-derivation of the compute-optimal frontier: given a fixed training compute budget, there's a specific ratio of parameters to training tokens that minimizes loss, and the earlier scaling-laws guidance had been well off that ratio, favoring oversized, undertrained models. The practical rule of thumb that emerged — roughly 20 training tokens per parameter — reshaped how every subsequent lab budgeted a training run, and shifted the industry's bottleneck away from 'how many parameters can we afford' and toward 'how much high-quality training data can we actually acquire,' a much harder problem to solve by just buying more GPUs.",

      "Think of a resource-allocation mistake where more of one input (money, time, people) was thrown at a problem while a different, cheaper input (planning, information, practice) was under-invested, producing worse results than a more balanced allocation would have.

      "Reinforcement learning can elicit strong reasoning in LLMs at a fraction of frontier training cost.",
    layer0:
      "DeepSeek, a Chinese AI lab, released an open-source reasoning model that matched top proprietary 'reasoning' models (like OpenAI's o1) on many benchmarks, while claiming a dramatically lower training and inference cost. The paper's core claim is that strong step-by-step reasoning ability can be taught to a language model largely through reinforcement learning — rewarding the model for correct final answers and consistent reasoning — rather than primarily through expensive, human-curated supervised fine-tuning data, which had been the more common assumption.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism, called Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), trains the model by generating multiple candidate reasoning attempts for a given problem, scoring them with rule-based rewards (mainly: did it reach the correct final answer, and did it stay in one consistent language rather than mixing languages mid-response), and reinforcing the patterns that led to higher-scoring attempts. Pure reinforcement learning from scratch tends to produce unstable, repetitive, or language-mixing behavior early on, so the approach uses a small amount of 'cold-start' example data to stabilize the model before RL takes over as the primary training signal. The result is a model that learns to self-correct and verify its own reasoning steps largely through trial-and-reward rather than being shown millions of hand-labeled reasoning examples.",

      "Think of a skill you or someone else got good at mostly through trial-and-error with feedback (win/lose, right/wrong) rather than through being explicitly taught step-by-step.

    thesis:
      "General methods that leverage computation ultimately beat human-knowledge-engineered approaches in AI.",
    layer0:
      "Sutton observed a repeating pattern across seven decades of AI research: researchers build systems that encode human expertise and intuition about a domain (like handcrafted chess strategies or linguistic grammar rules), these systems perform well initially, and then eventually get overtaken by much simpler, more general methods that just leverage more computation — search and learning — once enough compute becomes available. The 'bitter' part is that this keeps surprising and disappointing researchers who invested years building domain-specific expert knowledge into their systems, only to watch a more general, compute-hungry approach eventually surpass it.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism Sutton identifies is that human-engineered knowledge imposes a ceiling — it encodes what humans currently understand about a problem, which is necessarily limited and often subtly wrong in ways that are hard to detect. General methods (massive search, like the alpha-beta search behind Deep Blue's chess victory over Kasparov, or deep learning over massive datasets) don't have that ceiling; they can keep improving simply by throwing more computation at the same simple underlying method, and computation has historically kept getting cheaper on a predictable curve (following something like Moore's Law). So over a long enough time horizon, the 'dumb but scalable' method tends to overtake the 'smart but hand-crafted' one, because only the former can keep improving indefinitely as hardware improves.",
    layer2:
      "Think of a domain where you've seen 'expert hand-crafted rules' lose out over time to a cruder but more scalable approach (a rules-based email spam filter versus a learned one, a curated recommendation list versus a learned one). What was the specific ceiling the hand-crafted approach hit, and what made the scalable approach able to keep improving past it?",
