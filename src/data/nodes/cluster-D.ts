    category: "Investing",
    thesis:
      "Amateur investors have structural advantages over Wall Street professionals — the freedom to hold five stocks instead of five hundred, to ignore quarterly performance pressure, and to research industries they actually understand — and Lynch's rules are mostly about not squandering that edge.",
    layer0:
      "Your investor's edge isn't something you get from Wall Street experts. It's something you already have — as long as you don't throw it away chasing what the herd is doing.",
    layer1:
      "Several rules cluster around one insight: professional money managers are structurally disadvantaged by career risk and herd behavior, which the amateur investor doesn't share. Others are about company-level discipline — never invest in a company without understanding its finances, avoid hot stocks in hot industries (great companies in unglamorous, cold industries are consistently better performers), and study more companies rather than fewer, since 'if you study 10 companies, you'll find one for which the story is better than expected. If you study 50, you'll find five.' Lynch also stresses time horizon: 'time is on your side when you own shares of superior companies' and volatility itself ('a stock market decline is as routine as a January blizzard in Colorado') should be treated as opportunity, not crisis.",
    layer2:
      "The rule that cuts hardest against instinct is rule six: there is no correlation between a company's operational success and its stock's success over a few years, but a 100% correlation over the long term. Most investing mistakes come from confusing short-term stock price with long-term business performance. Which of your own holdings are you judging on the wrong time horizon right now?",

    author: "SK hynix (Chey Tae-won); TSMC; ASML",
    year: 2026,
    medium: "Framework",
    category: "Macro & Investing",
    thesis:
      "AI demand for compute and memory is compounding faster than physical fabrication capacity can be built, because building a new chip fab takes five-plus years no matter how much capital is thrown at it — creating a structural, multi-year supply gap that no amount of urgent spending can close early.",
    layer0:
      "SK hynix's chairman says customers want 4x-5x more memory supply, but even doubling wafer capacity will take until 2030. TSMC and ASML both raised 2026 capital spending guidance mid-year and are still telling investors the demand-supply gap is 'really big' and unquantifiable.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism is a lead-time mismatch, not a willingness-to-invest problem. SK hynix's chairman put a new ('greenfield') memory fab's build time at more than five years — meaning capacity ordered today lands near the tail end of the shortage window he's forecasting through 2030, not before it. TSMC's CEO said the same about advanced logic nodes: 'Building the capacity and then ramping it up now takes five to seven years. There are no shortcuts.' ASML, the sole supplier of the EUV lithography machines both companies depend on, is 'investigating' a further 30% capacity expansion for 2028 specifically because customer order signals are strong enough to justify it — but its own CFO wouldn't commit to a number, since matching supply to a demand curve that's still rising is inherently a moving target. Within memory specifically, the gap compounds further: high-bandwidth memory (HBM) consumes far more wafers per bit than ordinary DRAM and carries higher margins, so new capacity keeps tilting toward HBM — which starves standard DRAM supply even as chipmakers add wafers overall, explaining why DRAM contract prices reportedly rose roughly 63% quarter-over-quarter even as capacity investment accelerated.",
    layer2:
      "J.P. Morgan frames the same dynamic from the financing side, describing AI infrastructure build-out as a $1.5 trillion, decade-long undertaking on the scale of prior 'generational' infrastructure waves like highways and railroads — the point being that this isn't a shortage that gets fixed by writing a bigger check next quarter; the physical build time is the binding constraint, not the capital. When you're facing a demand surge in your own work, is the bottleneck actually money — or is it something with a fixed lead time that more money can't compress, and are you budgeting your patience accordingly?",
    quiz: {
      question:
        "According to SK hynix's chairman and TSMC's CEO, why can't the AI-driven chip and memory shortage be resolved quickly even with aggressive capital spending?",
      options: [
        "Because chipmakers are refusing to raise capital expenditure despite strong demand signals.",
        "Because building and ramping a new fab has a fixed lead time of roughly five to seven years regardless of how much capital is deployed, so today's spending increases can't produce supply before the early 2030s.",
        "Because AI demand for chips is actually expected to decline within the next year.",
        "Because export controls make it illegal to build new fabs anywhere outside of Taiwan.",
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation:
        "Both SK hynix's Chey Tae-won and TSMC's C.C. Wei independently cite the same structural constraint: a new fab's multi-year build-and-ramp timeline is fixed by physics and engineering complexity, not by capital availability — which is why both companies are raising 2026 spending while still forecasting shortages persisting through 2030.",
