      "Writing about skyscraper design in 'The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered,' Sullivan argued that nature never puts a decorative flourish where it doesn't serve survival — a hawk's wing is shaped by flight, not fashion — and buildings should follow the same logic. The phrase became the rallying cry for Bauhaus and modernist design decades later, though Sullivan himself still used plenty of ornament in his own buildings.",
