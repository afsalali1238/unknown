    thesis:
      "Writing online works as a compounding, non-scarce asset and a serendipity engine — shifting from 'Writing from Scarcity' (staring at a blank page) to 'Writing from Abundance' (systematically capturing raw material before you need it) is what separates writers who publish consistently from those who don't, and consistent publishing eventually creates a 'Personal Monopoly,' a unique intersection of knowledge and voice that attracts aligned opportunities without competing for attention.",
    layer0:
      "Perell's essay reframes online writing as a compounding asset rather than a broadcast tool: instead of sitting down to write with a blank page and hoping for inspiration, Writing from Scarcity, the sustainable approach is Writing from Abundance — building a habit of capturing ideas as raw material, from books, conversations, and stray thoughts, the moment they occur, so that by the time you sit down to write, you're editing and assembling pre-existing notes rather than generating ideas from nothing.",
    layer1:
      "He pairs this capture habit with what he calls the Content Triangle: an idea gets compressed first in conversation, to test the logic out loud, then tested in short-form posts, to gauge audience resonance, and only then developed into a full essay — each stage filtering out what doesn't land before the highest-cost stage, long-form writing, gets attempted. Consistent output through this process, he argues, eventually produces a Personal Monopoly: a specific intersection of knowledge, voice, and interests distinctive enough that a writer stops competing in a crowded market and instead becomes the only source for that particular combination of ideas, which pulls in aligned opportunities on its own.",

    thesis:
      "Luck isn't a single, uncontrollable force — it breaks into four distinct types, from pure chance to the luck you can systematically manufacture through motion, expertise, and a distinctive personal identity, meaning most of what determines your long-run 'luck' is actually a function of design choices, not chance.",
    layer0:
      "Drawing on neurologist James Austin's 1978 framework, Bloom breaks luck into four escalating types: Blind Luck, pure chance — where you're born, acts of God, entirely outside your control; Luck from Motion, generated simply by moving and acting, meeting people, trying things, increasing the number of possible collisions you could have; Luck from Awareness, spotting opportunities that only someone with deep domain expertise would even recognize as opportunities; and Luck from Uniqueness, a distinctive enough combination of skills and identity that opportunities seek you out rather than you chasing them.",
    layer1:
      "The progression matters because each type requires a different strategy and tends to dominate a different life stage: Type II luck, motion, is the right focus early on, showing up, saying yes, publishing consistently, since sheer volume of interaction is what a beginner can control. That accumulated experience is what eventually produces Type III, awareness, and sustained, distinctive output over years is what eventually produces Type IV, uniqueness, at which point you're no longer hunting for opportunities, since your specific, hard-to-replicate position starts attracting them on its own. The framework's practical use is as a diagnostic: if you feel stuck, the fix usually isn't 'wait for good luck,' it's identifying which type of luck you're currently capable of generating and doing more of exactly that.",
    layer2:
      "Which type of luck are you currently in the best position to generate — motion, through more volume and action, awareness, through deepening expertise in a specific domain, or uniqueness, through a distinctive combination you already have but haven't leaned into? What's one concrete action this week that matches that type?",

      "Logging a few sentences at the exact transition point between tasks — what you just did, how you feel, what's next — reduces cognitive load and counters procrastination more effectively than either rigid daily planning or end-of-day review, because it intervenes precisely at the moment attention is most likely to drift.",
    layer0:
      "Interstitial journaling, a technique Le Cunff adapted from Tony Stubblebine, replaces both the rigid forward-looking to-do list and the exhausting end-of-day review with something simpler: writing a timestamped note, a sentence or two, every time you finish one task and move to the next, capturing what you just did, any lingering thought or anxiety, and what you're about to start.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism works on two levels. First, it targets procrastination at its actual source — Le Cunff argues procrastination is usually an emotional-regulation problem, not a discipline problem, and naming a feeling, 'feeling anxious about this call,' in the moment lets the brain process it instead of escaping into a distraction. Second, it neutralizes the Zeigarnik effect, the tendency for unfinished tasks to keep nagging at working memory — dumping the loose thread into the journal before switching tasks frees up attention that would otherwise keep circling back to what's unfinished, making the next task easier to actually focus on.",
    layer2:
      "Notice the next time you finish a task and feel the pull toward a phone or a new tab before starting the next one. Try writing one timestamped line instead, what you just did, how you feel, what's next, and see whether that small pause changes what you do next.",

      "Johnny Carson tried to copy Jack Benny, failed, and won six Emmys. David Letterman tried to copy Carson, failed, and became one of the great television hosts. Conan O'Brien, looking at the same lineage, concluded that 'it is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique'. David Perell calls the opposite instinct the Originality Disease: the modern creator's fear that studying anyone else's style will contaminate their own, so they spend far more time straining for novelty than apprenticing to the people they admire — and quality is the casualty.",
    layer1:
      "Perell's evidence is that the people we treat as singular talents describe themselves as thieves. Tarantino: 'I steal from every single movie ever made.' George Lucas rewrote Star Wars to fit Joseph Campbell's hero's journey. Hunter S. Thompson retyped The Great Gatsby to feel what writing that well was like; Kobe Bryant said all his moves were stolen. Creators consume differently from audiences — a director watches a film for how the score builds empathy and how a camera move foreshadows a plot turn, building a mental board of techniques to borrow. Perell traces the disease to three sources: a misunderstanding of inspiration as lightning that must strike an uncontaminated mind; academia's fetish for the 'nobody has written this before' box, which confuses originality with usefulness; and a post-Freudian, post-1960s turn inward that treats the self as the only legitimate source of answers. His fix is a two-step apprenticeship. Imitate closely enough to learn the machinery, then let your own inevitable deviations accumulate — a painting teacher he quotes defines an artist's voice as the delta between their style and the painter they emulate. Imitating from far afield works too: Thiel from Girard, Jobs from Star Trek.",

So pick one piece of work you admire in your own medium and copy it properly — reverse-engineer its structure, rewrite it in your own context, notice exactly where you cannot help departing from it.

    layer0:
      "A friend once asked Sahil Bloom how often he saw his parents. About once a year, he said — they lived on the other coast and were in their mid-sixties. The friend did the arithmetic: so you will see them roughly fifteen more times before they die. Bloom moved back east within months. The story became the seed of a book whose claim is simple: we have been trained to treat money as the only form of wealth, so we run our lives on a scoreboard with one column and are surprised when winning on it does not feel like winning. Peter Drucker's line that what gets measured gets managed cuts both ways — a broken scoreboard produces broken actions.",
    layer1:
      "Bloom's scoreboard has five columns. Time Wealth is control over how you spend your hours and awareness of their finitude — the currency you cannot earn back. Social Wealth is depth and breadth of relationships, the asset that most reliably predicts a good life in the longitudinal data. Mental Wealth is purpose, growth and space to think. Physical Wealth is health and vitality, built on a handful of unglamorous principles about movement, food and sleep. Financial Wealth is the familiar one, reframed around defining your own 'enough' rather than chasing an open-ended number. The book, published in February 2025 after three years of research and interviews, argues that the five interact dynamically and that their relative weight changes across seasons of life: a founder in a sprint may deliberately run down Time and Social wealth for a while, but treating that as the permanent default is how people arrive at retirement rich and alone. The practical instrument is measurement — score yourself on all five, notice which column you have been ignoring, and let the weakest one set the next action. Bloom's recurring promise is that a single year of deliberate reallocation is enough to change the trajectory.",
    layer2:
      "Rate yourself honestly from one to ten on each of the five — time, social, mental, physical, financial — and look at the spread rather than the sum. The column with the lowest score is usually the one you have been quietly trading away to raise another. Bloom's fifteen-more-visits arithmetic works for anything finite: how many more summers with your kids at home, how many more conversations with a mentor, how many more years your body will tolerate the routine you are running. Which finite count would change your calendar this month if you actually did the math?",

Anne-Laure Le Cunff's replacement is the PACT: 'Publish 25 newsletters over the next 25 weeks.' Same ambition, but every part of it is an action you can take this week and mark as done or not done.",

      "PACT is Purposeful, Actionable, Continuous and Trackable. Purposeful means aligned with a long-term aim rather than merely relevant right now — you will not sustain a commitment you do not care about. Actionable shifts attention from distant outcomes to present outputs you control: the run, the call, the draft. Continuous means the action is simple and repeatable, which sidesteps the research-forever paralysis of too many options and lets you adapt as you learn. Trackable is deliberately not 'measurable': stats are overrated for most goals, so the tracking is binary, like a GitHub contribution graph — did you do the thing today, yes or no? The shift is from outcome to output, from a finish line to a cadence. In her 2025 book Tiny Experiments Le Cunff makes the PACT the core unit of a curiosity-driven life: 'I will [action] for [duration]', run for the stated period, then reviewed — continue, tweak or stop — with the outcome treated as information rather than a verdict. A missed day is a data point, not a failed goal, and the review is where the learning happens.",

        "A SMART goal targets an outcome you often cannot control, while a PACT commits you to a repeatable output you can perform and track as done or not done",
        "A SMART goal is designed for long-term ambitions, while a PACT is a short-term daily to-do list that should be rewritten every morning",
        "A SMART goal requires numerical measurement, while a PACT rejects tracking of any kind in favour of intuition about whether you are progressing",
        "A SMART goal is set individually, while a PACT is a formal agreement made with an accountability partner who enforces the deadline",

      explanation:
        "Le Cunff's example is the contrast between 'get 5,000 subscribers in 25 weeks' and 'publish 25 newsletters in 25 weeks': the first depends on factors outside your control, the second is purposeful, actionable, continuous and trackable with a simple yes or no.",
