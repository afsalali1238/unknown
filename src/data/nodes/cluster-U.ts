    medium: "Paper",
    category: "Cognitive Bias",
    thesis:
      "People systematically seek out, interpret, and remember information in ways that confirm their existing beliefs, while ignoring or discounting evidence that contradicts them — making it one of the most pervasive and hardest-to-correct biases because it operates on what evidence gets noticed in the first place, not just how it's judged afterward.",
    layer0:
      "Nickerson's review pulls together decades of scattered research to show confirmation bias isn't one narrow effect but a pattern that shows up in nearly every stage of reasoning: which questions we choose to ask, which sources we choose to consult, how we interpret ambiguous evidence, and what we remember afterward. All of these steps tend to tilt toward confirming what we already believed going in, often without any conscious intent to be biased.",
    layer1:
      "The bias operates at three points: search, where we ask questions designed to confirm rather than test our hypothesis, a behavior demonstrated experimentally by Peter Wason's earlier rule-discovery studies which Nickerson's review builds on; interpretation, where ambiguous or mixed evidence gets read as supporting our existing view; and memory, where confirming instances are recalled more easily than disconfirming ones. Because it acts this early and this broadly, simply presenting someone with contradicting facts often fails to correct it — the facts get filtered, reinterpreted, or forgotten before they can do their work.",

      "Pick a belief you hold strongly. The next time you research it, deliberately search for the single strongest argument against it, from its most credible opponent, before reading anything that supports your side.",

      "Prospect theory, the paper that eventually won Kahneman a Nobel Prize, replaced the classical economic assumption that people evaluate outcomes by their final wealth with a more accurate model: people evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to a reference point, usually the status quo, and the psychological impact of a loss is roughly twice as intense as an equally-sized gain — a ratio researchers now call the loss-aversion coefficient, typically found to cluster between 1.5 and 2.5.",

      "This asymmetry produces predictable, seemingly irrational patterns: people become risk-averse when facing possible gains, preferring a certain smaller reward over a risky larger one, but risk-seeking when facing possible losses, preferring a risky gamble to a certain loss of the same expected value, essentially gambling to avoid definitely losing. This is why people hold onto losing investments too long, since selling would lock in the painful loss, while selling winning investments too early, locking in the pleasant but smaller gain — the exact opposite of what a rational, forward-looking strategy would recommend in most cases.",
