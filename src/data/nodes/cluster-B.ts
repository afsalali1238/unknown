      "Eight engineers quit Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in 1957 because its founder, Nobel laureate William Shockley, was abrasive and paranoid to the point of being nearly unmanageable. They wanted to start their own company but had no personal capital and no existing playbook for funding something like this — banks didn't lend to unproven engineers with no product, and there was no venture capital industry yet to call. Arthur Rock, then a young banker, spent weeks pitching roughly 35 existing corporations to back the group as a new subsidiary. All 35 passed. Fairchild Camera and Instrument finally agreed, fronting the capital in exchange for the right to buy the whole new company outright later if it succeeded.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism Rock improvised — a corporate parent funds an independent new entity, gets an option to acquire it later rather than just buying stock upfront, and the founding engineers keep day-to-day control and equity in the meantime — is structurally the ancestor of the modern VC term sheet (investor capital in exchange for a claim on future value, founders retain operating control). Fairchild Camera and Instrument put in $1.38 million for the right to buy the whole company for $3 million within eight years, which it later exercised. That single deal proved something no one had proven before: that engineers with no assets except expertise and a grudge against a bad boss could be financed as a standalone company, not just hired as employees elsewhere.",

      "In 1957, two MIT Lincoln Laboratory engineers, Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson, wanted to build smaller, cheaper computers to challenge IBM's expensive mainframes. IBM and other established players had already turned them down, and at the time 'the computer business' was widely seen by investors as a money-loser — only giant, well-capitalized companies could survive it. So instead of asking for money to build computers, they proposed building profitable digital circuit modules first, using that revenue to prove the team and the technology worked, and only later building full interactive computers. American Research and Development Corporation (ARD), one of the first venture firms in the US, funded them: $70,000 in equity for 70% of the new company, Digital Equipment Corporation, plus a further loan.",
    layer1:
      "The mechanism here is sequencing risk to match what investors could actually stomach. A direct pitch — 'give us money to build computers' — was, at the time, effectively unfundable, because the category itself had a bad reputation with capital allocators. By proposing a lower-risk first product (circuit modules, already known to be sellable and profitable) that would generate real revenue and de-risk the team's execution ability, Olsen and Anderson gave ARD a way to say yes to something that looked like a normal, provable business, while quietly building toward the bigger and riskier ambition. DEC's PDP series of minicomputers later undercut mainframe prices by an order of magnitude, and ARD's $70,000 stake was worth $355 million by 1971 — the return that made the entire ARD fund look successful, and helped convince other institutional money that venture capital as an asset class could work.",

      "Think of an ambitious goal you have that would be hard to get anyone to back directly because the category has a bad reputation or looks too risky on its face. What's the smaller, provable, revenue-generating version of that goal you could pitch first — one that builds credibility and capital toward the bigger ambition, the way circuit modules did for DEC's computers?",

Roelof Botha, a Sequoia partner, wrote an internal memo arguing the firm should invest anyway, because the sheer volume and growth rate of user-generated video uploads was a leading indicator that YouTube was becoming the default place people went to watch and share video online — a position worth being early to regardless of how monetization would eventually work. Sequoia invested $1 million, followed by a $4 million Series A. Google acquired YouTube about eighteen months later for $1.65 billion, returning roughly 57x to Sequoia.",

Botha's bet was that becoming the default consumer habit for a category — 'the place you go to watch a video' — creates a position so valuable that a monetization strategy can be figured out later, whereas waiting for a proven revenue model before investing would mean missing the window entirely, since by the time revenue is proven the position is already taken by someone else. This is the same logic later formalized in aggregation-style thinking: owning the user's default behavior first, monetizing the resulting leverage second.",

The deck leaned on real usage data — about 90 million pageviews a month within its first year — to make the case that attention, not raw headcount, was the sellable asset.",

      "The mechanism is substituting engagement depth for audience size as the metric that actually matters to an advertiser.

The deck's own financial projections were modest by today's standards: a best-case scenario of $1 billion in revenue, a more realistic target of reaching 5% of top US cities and $20 million in profit. It raised roughly $200,000.",

Positioning as a premium, invite-only alternative to black-car services (a small, already-proven market) made the pitch legible and fundable, even though the deck itself briefly touched on ride-pooling concepts (UberPool) years before that ever launched — meaning the bigger idea existed in the founders' heads, but wasn't what got pitched first. This mirrors a broader pattern: ambitious ideas often get funded initially as a smaller, adjacent, already-validated market, with the larger vision earned incrementally as traction accumulates.",
