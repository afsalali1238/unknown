# Unknown — Workflow & UI/UX Proposal (v2: minimal, named for reading, not video)

Revises the first draft on three points: the glimpse mode needs a name that belongs to reading, not to video; the tone throughout should read as considered and literary, not gamified; and the nav should be cut to the fewest tabs that still cover the whole product. Still builds on what's already in the repo — `docs/PRODUCT-BRIEF.md`, `docs/FEED-SPEC.md`, and the unbuilt `design_handoff_reels_and_nav/` handoff — nothing here contradicts those, it sharpens the naming and trims the surface area.

---

## 1. Naming: drop "Reels"

"Reels" borrows a video app's vocabulary for a text product, and it undersells what the mode actually is — a fast pass through the lattice, one idea's thesis at a time, the reading equivalent of flipping through a stack of index cards or scanning a table of contents. Video terms also work against the audience: someone who thinks in Munger's latticework and reads primary documents for fun isn't looking for something that sounds like short-form video.

**Recommendation: `Skim`.** It's a real, precise verb for what's happening (you skim a text before you commit to reading it), it's one syllable, and it sets the correct expectation — thin, fast, no commitment — the same way "Review" and "Explore" set expectations elsewhere in the app. Route: `/skim`. Tab label: **Skim**.

If you want something a touch more literary: **`Glimpses`** (noun, matches "a glimpse of an idea") or **`Digest`** (evokes a considered summary, slightly more formal). `Skim` is the recommendation — shortest, clearest, most self-explanatory to a first-time user, no explanation needed.

Everything the Reels handoff already designed (full-bleed thesis card, swipe to advance, tap to open the full node) carries over unchanged — only the name and the tab copy change.

---

## 2. Minimal nav: four tabs, not five

The product brief's own principle (§5) is that six flat tabs caused decision paralysis, and it correctly cut to three. Adding Feed and then a fifth tab for the glimpse mode undoes that discipline. Cutting back:

**Feed · Skim · Review · You**

- **Explore is folded, not deleted.** Its two views (curated topic collections, and the full lattice list with progress rings) move one tap down, inside **You**, under a single "Library" section — this is where a considered reader goes when they want the _whole_ map, not the algorithmic feed. It doesn't need to compete for bottom-bar space with the two things you actually do daily (read, review).
- **Skim absorbs Explore's "browse broadly" job.** Skimming through the lattice at speed already _is_ browsing everything — a separate top-level tab for the same intent is redundant surface area, not a distinct job.
- Four words, read once, understood permanently: **Feed** (what's for me today), **Skim** (flip through the lattice fast), **Review** (what I owe my memory), **You** (my library, my progress, myself).

## 3. The fix you asked for first: make "read more" explicit

A Feed card currently only implies it opens into something larger — the tap is a hidden affordance, an interaction with no visible signifier. A considered reader shouldn't have to discover this by accident; state it plainly, the way a table of contents states what a chapter contains.

```
[the hook — one paragraph, the idea in plain terms]

Continue reading — the mechanism, how to apply it, and what it connects to  →
```

Written as a sentence, not an icon or a vague ellipsis — it tells the reader exactly what's ahead (mechanism, application, connections) before they commit the tap. This is closer to how a serious publication labels a "continued on page 4" jump than to a social app's "…more." Keep it as plain text, `font-sans`, `text-ink-soft`, no button chrome — it should read as an editorial cue, not a UI control begging to be clicked.

---

## 4. What each screen is for, in one line each — nothing extra

- **Feed** — the reading chosen for you today, from what you told it you care about.
- **Skim** — the entire lattice, one thesis at a time, for when you want breadth instead of depth.
- **Node** — the full idea: plain explanation, mechanism, application, a recall check, and what it connects to.
- **Review** — what's due to be tested today, so it actually stays with you.
- **You** — your queue, your saved library, the full lattice list, your progress.

Two save actions only, never blurred together, named for what they mean rather than borrowed music-app jargon: **Queue** (I intend to read this next) and **Save** (I want this in my library, indefinitely). One tap from either sits inside **You**.

---

## 5. Tone: write for someone who already reads primary sources

The copy throughout should assume the reader already respects ideas — no manufactured urgency, no gamified language ("streak," if kept, should read as a quiet counter, not a flame emoji or a badge popup). A few concrete swaps:

| Avoid                              | Use instead                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Swipe for your next hit of ideas" | "Skim the lattice"                                                                              |
| "Reels"                            | "Skim"                                                                                          |
| icon-only buttons with no label    | one word under every icon, at least on first use                                                |
| "🔥 3 day streak!"                 | "3 days" in quiet numerals, no emoji                                                            |
| "You'll love this!"                | the credential line — author, year, category — let the source's authority speak, not enthusiasm |

## 6. What to build first

1. Rename the Reels handoff to **Skim** before building it — same design, new name, one 5th tab collapses back into the existing bar by absorbing Explore's job.
2. Add the literal "Continue reading — …" line under every Feed card's hook.
3. Fold Explore's two views (curated collections, full lattice) into a **Library** section inside **You**.
4. Rename any "queue vs. saved" copy so the two are never ambiguous — Queue = next, Save = library.

Everything else in `PRODUCT-BRIEF.md` and `FEED-SPEC.md` stands as written — this is a naming and surface-area trim, not a rebuild.
